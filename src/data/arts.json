The story explores the impact of **“Remember 3,”** a service offered by the company **“Inertial,”** which provides an **AI humanoid robot** designed to replace a deceased loved one and erase painful memories of their loss. This service, using the deceased's DNA, creates a robot with an identical appearance and memory. In a society that values emotional control and convenience, people willingly accept this as **a new form of a funeral** or mourning process."

However, a series of unsettling discoveries forces her to confront a painful truth: her beloved husband is dead. The story culminates in her conscious choice to reject the service's ‘maintenance’ procedures and fully embrace the grief she was meant to forget. In doing so, she **rejects societal norms** and reclaims her authentic self, finding happiness by accepting that life includes both sorrow and joy."

The title, “Bug Effect,” refers not only to the technical glitches in AI but also to the emotional ‘bugs’ that disrupt artificial peace and ultimately lead to **growth and self-acceptance**."
