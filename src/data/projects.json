To provide a solution, we developed an application named 'HalmaeYakson (Grandma's Healing Hands)', inspired by the traditional Korean children's song, 'Grandma's Hands are Healing Hands.' Following the ideation stage, we proceeded with screen design and prototype development, ultimately presenting our completed concept.
